# antigravity-workspace
This repo contains front end code with angular, Middle ware code with Springboot application and back sql script for MySQL created using Google Antigrativty tool

# `antigravity-workspace`

This repository holds a full-stack application workspace generated using the **Google Antigravity tool**. It contains the complete codebase split into three main components: a frontend, a backend, and a database schema.

-----

## 🚀 Project Overview

The `antigravity-workspace` is designed as a classic **three-tier architecture**, utilizing modern, popular frameworks for each layer:

1.  **Frontend:** Built with **Angular** for a dynamic user interface.
2.  **Middleware/Backend:** A **Spring Boot application** written in **Java**, serving as the API layer.
3.  **Database:** SQL scripts for setting up the relational database using **MySQL**.

This structure demonstrates a standard approach to enterprise application development, where each layer is distinct and communicates via defined interfaces.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

The project is built using the following key technologies and languages:

| Component | Technology | Language |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | Angular | TypeScript, HTML, CSS |
| **Backend** | Spring Boot | Java |
| **Database** | SQL Scripts | MySQL |

-----

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized into three main directories corresponding to the architectural layers:

```
antigravity-workspace/
├── backend/            # Spring Boot application (Java/Maven/Gradle)
├── database/           # MySQL SQL script files for schema and data setup
├── frontend/           # Angular application source code
├── README.md           # This file
└── package-lock.json   # Frontend dependency lock file (Node.js/npm)
```

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

  * **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+** (Required for the Spring Boot backend)
  * **Maven** or **Gradle** (For building the Spring Boot backend)
  * **Node.js & npm** (Required for the Angular frontend)
  * **MySQL Server** (Required for the database)

### 1\. Database Setup

1.  Navigate to the `database/` directory.

2.  Execute the provided SQL script(s) against your local MySQL instance to create the necessary schema and tables.

    ```bash
    # Example command (may vary based on your setup)
    mysql -u [USER] -p < database/[your_script_name].sql
    ```

### 2\. Backend Installation and Run

1.  Navigate to the `backend/` directory.

2.  Build the Spring Boot application (e.g., using Maven):

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ./mvnw install
    ```

3.  Ensure your **database connection details** (URL, username, password) are correctly configured in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file within the backend source code.

4.  Run the application:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

    The backend API should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3\. Frontend Installation and Run

1.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.

2.  Install the required Node.js dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the Angular development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The frontend application will compile and launch in your browser, typically on `http://localhost:4200`.
